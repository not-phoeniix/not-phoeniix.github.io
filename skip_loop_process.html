            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                SKIP_LOOP_PROCESS is a small arcade-style platformer with
                a super simple game loop. Get from point A to point B
                within the time limit. Once you get there, you'll be
                spawned back in, tasked to do the same thing again with
                one key difference. You must avoid touching the ghost of
                your previous run. How far can you get before dying?
            </p>

            <p>
                This game concept was completed as a final project for my
                Advanced Gameplay Programming course in the Godot engine.
                I spent some time during the summer after the course had
                ended to remake the game in my
                <a href="sprks_engine.html">Sprks Engine</a>. This new version
                added a level editor, more dynamic UI, a grappling hook,
                lighting, and a unique post processing shader.
            </p>

            <p>
                This game is currently being worked on and I hope to publish
                it some day soon on itch.io.
            </p>

            <h2>The Tech</h2>

            <p>
                This project is made in the Sprks Engine and programmed in C#.
                Many of the engine tools I've developed are in use here, from
                the UI framework to the modifiable post processing pipeline.
            </p>
