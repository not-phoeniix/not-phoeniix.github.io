            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
                Adumbration is a short top-down 2D puzzle game. This was
                created along with 3 other team members in the Game
                Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving course. This
                project and course was what introduced me to the MonoGame
                framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                For our project, I was tasked with the creation of the level
                loading system and implementing game lighting. We used an
                existing open source project titled Penumbra for lighting.
            </p>
