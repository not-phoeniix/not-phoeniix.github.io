            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
                SKINNERET is a first-person 3D horror game where you have
                to avoid a dangerous entity to be able to escape a large manor!
                This project was created over the course of a semester for the
                Production Studio course at RIT.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project and class in general taught me a lot about working
                in a production environment. I served as team lead for this
                4 person project and managed tasks using agile-style sprints,
                standups, and other techniques. Alongside being the team lead, I
                worked as the audio engineer for this project. I designed and
                implemented sound effects across the whole project, performing
                fast iteration and testing with the rest of the team surrounding
                playtests.
            </p>

            <p>
                The tools we used for this project were fairly simple. We used
                Godot as our main game engine where the bulk of the design and
                programming took place. We programmed the game in GDScript due
                to its tighter integration with the engine (alongside our desire
                to learn the language better). In terms of asset production,
                Bitwig Studio was used for all audio, Autodesk Maya was used
                for 3D modelling, and Adobe Substance Painter was used for texture
                work.
            </p>

            <p>
                In terms of project management, we also utilized Trello and
                GitHub for organization. We stuck to Trello for our task board
                because it was flexible and robust for our usecase. We also stuck
                with GitHub and git in general for our source control because workflows
                across branches utilizing GitHub's Pull Requests allowed all the
                team members to effectively collaborate without too many merge
                conflicts or other codebase catastrophies.
            </p>
