            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Goober Game is a passion project that has spanned over a year's
                worth of work. It's a 2D space exploration survival game set in
                a small solar system comprised of a few planets of differing
                environments and climates. It is far from complete, but it is the
                single project I have poured the most hours into. I am very happy
                with its progress so far despite how far it has to go.
            </p>

            <h2>The Tech</h2>

            <p>
                Goober Game has been a massive undertaking technically. The
                massive scope certainly doesn't help my case as a solo developer.
                This game runs in a custom engine designed by myself, which is
                detailed below.
            </p>

            <p>
                The engine I've been building for this project is based on the
                MonoGame framework. It utilizes C# across its entire codebase,
                which is rapidly growing each day. There are also other languages
                utilized, such as JSON files for game config data importing/saving,
                and shader effect code written in HLSL.
            </p>

            <h2>The Art</h2>

            <p>
                Goober Game has been my first large project in an artistic aspect.
                I create all the pixel art for this game, and despite it not being
                as technical as the code aspect, I develop and create using the
                same approach as when extending my codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whenever I approach a new issue with sprite creation
                or general visual or artistic design, I apply the same method of
                fast iteration with continuous testing. This approach to design
                in general has yielded me great results thus far, and has allowed
                me to stay open minded and create the best game I can, both visually
                and technically.
            </p>
