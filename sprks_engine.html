            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>
                The Sprks Engine is a custom 2D game engine build on top
                of the MonoGame framework. Its codebase began with the
                <a href="nullspace.html">Nullspace</a> project back in 2023.
            </p>

            <p>
                The engine also has a very barebones 3D rendering test that
                I plan on expanding on in the future. I haven't had the time
                to flesh-out the 3D pipeline but some of the back-end support
                is there. This includes things like <b>Scene3D</b>,
                <b>Actor3D</b>, <b>Light3D</b>, and a few basic 3D components.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am very passionate about free and open source software, so
                the Sprks Engine is released on GitHub fully open source under
                the MIT license.
            </p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>

            <p>
                There are a handful of projects I've started developing
                in this engine. I have a few samples to show how to do
                some basic things in the engine. These can be found in
                the project repo,
                <a href="https://github.com/not-phoeniix/SprksEngine/tree/main/Samples" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Two games have been developed with this engine so far,
                <a href="nullspace.html">Nullspace</a> and
                <a href="skip_loop_process.html">SKIP_LOOP_PROCESS</a>.
                Both of these games are unfinished as I've had to
                focused my attention on university coursework, but they
                are more fully-fledged projects built using this engine.
                They're not open source because I hope to publish them
                one day :]
            </p>
