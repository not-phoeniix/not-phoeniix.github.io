                Hiya, I'm Nikki! I'm a third year Game Design and Development major
                at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My pronouns are she/they,
                and I'm super passionate about linux, pixel art, game development,
                open source software, and all things coding in general!
            </p>

            <p>
                My current skillset is comprised of a lot of back-end development. I'm most
                familiar and skilled with <b>C#</b> and <b>C++</b>, but I have done work and
                I'm comfortable with many other languages like <b>C</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>,
                <b>HTML/CSS</b>, and <b>Python</b>. I've done a lot of systems development for 
                many of my <b>projects</b>, and I very much enjoy the process 
                of this particular part of back-end development. I'm familiar with and have 
                done work in many game engines such as <b>Unity</b>, <b>Godot</b>, and <b>Unreal</b>.
                I've also worked with many frameworks and development tools such as <b>MonoGame/XNA</b>, <b>AGS</b>, 
            </p>

                I've been for several years now, I began experimenting with the JavaScript
                learning environment on Khan Academy in 4th grade. My first serious step
                into coding projects started in freshman year of high school, where I
                took an intro to computer science class, and followed up the following
                year with the advanced second class.
            </p>

            <p>
                I took these fundamentals and moved into serious passion project coding
                with my <a href="projects/watchfaces.html">watchfaces projects</a>.
                These were coded in C, and were the most complicated projects I'd completed
                thus far. This is what really kicked off my passion for coding, and the
                fact that my first big project language was C gave me the fundamentals
                I needed to excel when I started to learn other languages.
            </p>

            <p>
                Nowadays, my focus has shifted to my
                <a href="projects/goober_game.html">solo game project</a>.
                I've been working very hard and with much passion to bring my ideas
                to life, learning a ton about good coding practices and various languages
                along the way.
