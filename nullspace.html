            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Nullspace is a passion project that has spanned over two year's
                worth of work. It's a 2D space exploration survival game set in
                a small solar system comprised of a few planets of differing
                environments and climates. It is far from complete, but it is the
                single project I have poured the most hours into. I am very happy
                with its progress so far despite how far it has to go.
            </p>

            <h2>The Tech</h2>

            <p>
                Nullspace has been a massive undertaking technically.
                This game began development in early 2023 and developed into what
                would become the <a href="sprks_engine.html">Sprks Engine</a>. It
                contains a general scene-actor system with an entity-component
                architecture, along with dynamic spatial partitioning to support
                the updating and rendering of such a large proc-gen world.
            </p>

            <p>
                I built the codebase for this game with the intention of being robust.
                This allowed the transition to the Sprks Engine to be relatively smooth,
                as many systems could be directly ported over.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project also utilizes a custom deferred rendering system for
                interesting 2D dynamic lighting. Shadows are cast using a screenspace
                ray marching shader and hundreds of scene lights can be rendered at
                once due to the nature of a deferred rendering system.
            </p>

            <h2>The Art</h2>

            <p>
                Nullspace has been my first large project in an artistic aspect.
                I create all the pixel art for this game, and despite it not being
                as technical as the code aspect, I develop and create using the
                same approach as when extending my codebase.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whenever I approach a new issue with sprite creation
                or general visual or artistic design, I apply the same method of
                fast iteration with continuous testing. This approach to design
                in general has yielded me great results thus far, and has allowed
                me to stay open minded and create the best game I can, both visually
                and technically.
            </p>
