        <p>
            Hi! I'm Nikki, I'm a second year Game Design and Development major
            and the Rochester Institute of Technology. I'm a huge coding nerd,
            and I love all things open source and hackable.
        </p>

            My pronouns are she/they, and my favorite flavor of autism is linux
            customization/personalization :D (low level programming languages
            take a close second place)
        </p>

        <h3>Watchfaces</h3>
        <p>
            Over the course of high school, I spent a bit of my free time
            learning the C programming language by coding watchfaces for the
            Pebble smartwatch platform! The Pebble (now "Rebble") community
            is an active and tightly-knit collection of passionate people
            trying to keep the idea of the Pebble platform alive through crowd
            funding and open source software, several years after the original
            company went under and was bought by Fitbit. You can find more info
            <a href="projects/watchfaces.html">here</a> !!
