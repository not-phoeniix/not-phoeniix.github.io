            <p>
                Hiya, I'm Nikki! I'm a third year Game Design and Development major
                at the Rochester Institute of Technology. My pronouns are she/they,
                and I'm super passionate about linux, pixel art, game development,
                open source software, and all things coding in general!
            </p>

            <p>
                My current skillset is comprised of a lot of back-end development. I'm most
                familiar and skilled with <b>C#</b> and <b>C++</b>, but I have done work and
                I'm comfortable with many other languages like <b>C</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>,
                <b>TypeScript</b>, <b>HTML/CSS</b>, <b>Python</b>, and more!
            </p>

            <p>
                I've worked on systems development on many projects and I enjoy the
                process of this particular part of back-end development to a great extent.
                I'm familiar with and have done work in many game engines such as <b>Unity</b>,
                <b>Godot</b>, and <b>Unreal</b>. I've also worked with many frameworks and
                development tools such as <b>MonoGame/XNA</b>, <b>AGS/Astal</b>, <b>p5.js</b>,
                <b>OpenGL</b> with <b>freeGLUT</b>, and more! I'm even building my own game engine!
            </p>
